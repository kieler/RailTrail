# RailTrail
This is the code repository of the RailTrail project, which is part of the [REAKT initiative](https://www.schiene-m-l.de/) aiming to support individual transport on rails. The goal of this project is to develop a fullstack system to track and monitor vehicles on a rail track. The tracking is done by trackers mounted on a vehicle and also by apps used by passengers riding the vehicle. The backend then stores and processes this tracking data before the app or the administrative website displays it.

More detailed information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/kieler/RailTrail/wiki). Good starting points are maybe:
- The [overview of the system structure](https://github.com/kieler/RailTrail/wiki/System-structure-&-Tech-Stack) to get a better understanding, what each part does and how the data flows.
- Or the [guide](https://github.com/kieler/RailTrail/wiki/Deployment-of-server-&-website) on how to build and deploy the server and the website. The [`README.txt`](https://github.com/kieler/RailTrail/tree/development/App/RailTrail#readme) in the app directory provides similar instructions for the app (as it was not part of the actual project, more on this in the wiki itself).
